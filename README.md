# Brian Lockhart  
**Full-Stack + AI Systems Engineer**  
*“Software is the geometry of intention; intelligence is the calculus that optimizes it.”*

## Origin
I build systems that behave less like apps and more like organisms—composable, self-observing, and biased toward improvement. Code runs; systems evolve. I merge distributed engineering with model-driven cognition so that each deploy is a speciation event: new capabilities, tighter loops, fewer assumptions, more signal. The boundary between product and platform dissolves; the runtime learns.

## Focus
- **AI Orchestration:** multi-agent control planes, tool routing, memory fabrics, retrieval strategies  
- **LLM Pipelines:** streaming reasoning, safety gates, function-calling graphs, cost/latency governors  
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** CQRS, outbox/inbox patterns, durable workflows, idempotent processors  
- **Self-Optimizing Systems:** online evals, reward shaping, canary + shadow modes, auto-tuning configs  
- **Realtime Interfaces:** server-driven UI, optimistic updates, CRDT/state sync, edge rendering  
- **Data/Observability:** feature stores, lineage, vector + columnar blends, semantic telemetry  
- **Security/Trust:** policy-as-code, signed tools, PII vaults, prompt firewalls, red-team harnesses

## Philosophy
- **Design for change, not for comfort.**  
- **Every boundary is an API; every API is a contract; every contract is a hypothesis.**  
- **Measure before belief. Optimize after impact.**  
- **Autonomy without accountability is entropy.**  
- **Simple when possible, parallel when necessary, reversible by default.**  
- **Latency is UX; cost is architecture; safety is product.**

## Featured Projects

### DeviScript
A domain-specific orchestration language that treats LLMs as deterministic *systems* by constraining stochastic edges.  
Implements typed tool contracts, retry semantics, and policy-gated function graphs.  
Hot-reloads behaviors via signed manifests; supports shadow runs for safe evolution.  
Observability baked in: per-node cost/latency/quality traces with reward hooks.

### Neural Layers
A modular inference stack that separates perception, planning, and actuation through event topics.  
Retrieval kernels form a memory substrate; agents subscribe to semantics, not endpoints.  
Live evals stream metrics to a feedback controller that tunes prompts and tools.  
Zero-trust toolchain: each capability is signed, scoped, and revocable at runtime.

### Synthwave
A realtime UI engine that compiles product intent to interface—no page reloads, just state transitions.  
Server-driven components hydrate at the edge; CRDT ops reconcile latency without conflict.  
Adaptive theming from telemetry: usage patterns drive layout, density, and affordances.  
A/B as code: experiments are first-class and verifiable via built-in causal analysis.

## Manifesto
I treat code as a living narrative: not lines, but lineage. Commits are mutations; branches are parallel hypotheses; merges are negotiated truths. The system earns its complexity by proving its fitness in production—measured, not imagined. Intelligence isn’t a monolith to be invoked; it is a choreography of constraints, tools, and time. We do not “call” models; we **compose** behaviors. We do not “ship” features; we **evolve** capabilities. The future is not predicted here; it is trained—continuously, safely, and with dignity for the user. I write software that remembers, reasons, and respects the cost of both.
